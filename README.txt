This is just a sandbox for testing communication between Python and a small serial GPS unit.

The GPS unit: http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8936

Currently, uses Python to host a web server - with google maps displaying data from the gps unit via ajax calls.

Future ideas
------------

Also, will be using pyglet to do the visualisation - maybe even link into the google api for maps...
